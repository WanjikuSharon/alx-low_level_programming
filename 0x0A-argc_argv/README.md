Resources To be updated once I know how to attach documnets

Tasks
- 1-args.c - A program that prints its name, followed by a new line
    - If you rename the program, it will print the new name, without having to compile it again.
    - You should not remove the path before the name of the program.
    - Compile the code this way: `gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 0-whatsmyname.c -o mynameis`
- 2-args.c - A program that prints the number of arguments passed into it.
    - Your program should print a number, followed by a new line.
    - Compile the code this way: `gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 1-args.c -o nargs`
- 3-mul.c - A program that multiplies two numbers.
    - Your program should print the result of the multiplication, followed by a new line.
    - You can assume that the two numbers and result of the multiplication can be stored in an integer.
    - If the program does not receive two arguments, your program should print `Error`, followed by a new line, and return `1`.
    - Compile the code this way: `gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 3-mul.c -o mul`
